## Installation

Install the WhatsApp Business Platform SDK:

```bash
npm install @great-detail/whatsapp
# or PNPM or Yarn
```

## Getting started

The primary source of documentation (at the moment) for the usage of this SDK is
via JSDoc comments in the source code (and editor integrations).

```ts
import Client from "@great-detail/whatsapp"; // or require("@great-detail/whatsapp");

// Instantiate the SDK Client
const sdk = new Client({
  request: {
    headers: { Authorization: "Bearer ..." },
  },
});

// Use it!
const message = await sdk.message.createMessage({
  phoneNumberID: "123...809",
  to: "1234567890",
  type: "text",
  text: { body: "Hello" },
});
```

## Compatibility

This SDK is designed to be compatible with the Cloud API API.

| SDK  | Cloud API | NodeJS |
| :--- | :-------: | -----: |
| v8.x |    v23    |   v20+ |

Whilst the SDK may work with alternative versions of the Graph API, it is
designed to work with the above. If you find any compatibility issues, please
report them via
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/great-detail/WhatsApp-Nodejs-SDK/issues).

See this SDK's
[Changelog](https://github.com/great-detail/WhatsApp-Nodejs-SDK/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
for updates and release notes.

**Tested on NodeJS LTS Versions**: `v22`, `v24`.

Additional NodeJS versions may also work, however, automated testing requires
NodeJS' test suite, which was introduced in `v21`.
