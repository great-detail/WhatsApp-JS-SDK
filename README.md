# Node.js SDK for WhatsApp Business Platform APIs

An unofficial SDK for Meta's WhatsApp Business Messaging APIs - Cloud API.
Originally a fork of the
[deprecated official SDK for Meta's WhatsApp Business Messaging APIs](https://github.com/WhatsApp/WhatsApp-Nodejs-SDK).

[![npm (scoped)][]][sdk-npmjs]

[npm (scoped)]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40great-detail/whatsapp
[sdk-npmjs]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@great-detail/whatsapp

See this SDK's
[Changelog](https://github.com/great-detail/WhatsApp-Nodejs-SDK/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
for updates and release notes.

## Installation

Install the WhatsApp Business Platform SDK:

```bash
npm install @great-detail/whatsapp
# or PNPM or Yarn
```

## Getting started

The primary source of documentation (at the moment) for the usage of this SDK is
via JSDoc comments in the source code (and editor integrations).

```ts
import Client from "@great-detail/whatsapp"; // or require("@great-detail/whatsapp");

// Instantiate the SDK Client
const sdk = new Client({
  request: {
    headers: { Authorization: "Bearer ..." },
  },
});

// Use it!
const message = await sdk.message.createMessage({
  phoneNumberID: "123...809",
  to: "1234567890",
  type: "text",
  text: { body: "Hello" },
});
```

## Compatibility

This SDK is designed to be compatible with the Cloud API API.

| SDK  | Cloud API | NodeJS |
| :--- | :-------: | -----: |
| v8.x |    v23    |   v20+ |

Whilst the SDK may work with alternative versions of the Graph API, it is
designed to work with the above. If you find any compatibility issues, please
report them via
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/great-detail/WhatsApp-Nodejs-SDK/issues).

See this SDK's
[Changelog](https://github.com/great-detail/WhatsApp-Nodejs-SDK/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
for updates and release notes.

**Tested on NodeJS LTS Versions**: `v22`, `v24`.

Additional NodeJS versions may also work, however, automated testing requires
NodeJS' test suite, which was introduced in `v21`.

## Migrating v7 to v8

v8 of this SDK increased the minimum supported NodeJS version to v20.19.0,
alongside the release of support for
[`require()` with ESM](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v20.19.0).
This also coincides with NodeJS v18 reaching EOL, thus making the minimum LTS
NodeJS version v20.

This update to the minimum supported NodeJS version allows us to greatly
decrease the bundle size due to releasing ESM-only builds. Consumers in a CJS
environment should
[still be able to use the library as before](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v20.19.0).

v8 also removes the CLI aspect of this package. This change comes as the CLI
aspect of this SDK hasn't been updated since early development and support for
later functionality was not added. This too allows for a reduction in bundle
size.

v8 of this SDK also updates the default Meta Graph API version to `v23.0` -
whilst this update should maintain compatibility, to remain on the previous
Graph API version (`v20.0`) update instantiation of this client as follows:

```ts
// To remain on the previous Graph API version:
const sdk = new Client({
  // Add this line to the instantiation options:
  graphVersion: "v20.0",
  // ...
});
```

## TODO

There are a number of features supported by the WhatsApp Business Cloud API that
are yet to be implemented in this SDK. Please feel free to contribute via a Pull
Request, or note your interest in particular features by creating an issue for
it.

- [ ] Interactive Message Types.
- [ ] Template Message Types.
- [ ] Button Message Types.
- [ ] Flow Message Types.
- [ ] List Message Types.
- [x] WABA Webhook Subscription Management.
- [ ] WABA Extended Credit Management.
- [x] WABA Phone Number Management.
- [ ] WABA System User Management?
